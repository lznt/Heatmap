Heatmap
=======

Create HeatMap from GameAnalytics coordinates. Supports XYZ and GPS coordinates.

Gets GPS coordinates of Spray events for each team as user wants to do it, or for all teams of course.
You can also choose the data according to playing date (last day 4th day info is missing so this was not included.)

If you have coordinate data from Oulu3D in cartesian coordinates, as we have for policebusts, there is a formula which translates cartesian to GPS. After this you can just give the coordinates to Google HeatMap API and it will work.

I will later document this better.
